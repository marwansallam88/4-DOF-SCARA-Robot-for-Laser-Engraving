Key aspects:

• Designed and built a working SCARA robot using SOLIDWORKS, with a modular end-effector for laser engraving and future tool swapping.
• Developed robot motion control by deriving kinematics and dynamics, then validated via MATLAB/Simulink simulations.
• Programmed and customized Marlin firmware on Arduino MEGA for precise motion control; generated laser engraving G-code using Inkscape.
